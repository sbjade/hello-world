# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub. Yay!

My name is Sameer. I am learning Java and OOP. Today, I filled air in my new bike for the first time. My bike has presta valves and this was my first time filling air in a presta valve. It is quite tricky and I had kind of a hard time; but I think I have now filled the air in both tubes.

Thanks for reading!
